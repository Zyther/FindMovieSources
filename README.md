# FindMovieSources
FindMovieSources -- An easy way to find legit sources for movies.

# My sources API is starting to charge me on 9/1, and I need help creating a search aggregator to replace it. 
I make no money on this project, and host it myself. I wrote it because I needed it in my life, and hits approx. 1000 users weekly. I'd like some help replacing the "movie source" engine. Maybe, just maybe, we can have an open, legit media search engine :) 

## IMPORTANT!!!!
* All API keys have been replaced with `REDACTED` or `redacted`
* These APIs are all free, so please don't be an *** and just tell me if you find an API key. 
* most of `views/` is obsolete. See `webapp/`

## Install Notes
* `npm install`
* `npm start`
* Will probably error, install prereq npm complains about via `npm install <package-this-app-breaks-on> --save`
